# Bounties
There are bounties!

These are specifications for work that helps NEAR and the NEAR ecosystem.  The [Issues tab](https://github.com/Narwallets/bounties/issues) will list each of these and their labels will help you search for what you want. 

## Overview: Calling Developers, Designers, Product People and Founders!

To help the community better participate in the creation of everything from core infrastructure to design sprints, this repo is designed to surface the key needs discovered by people who are working on the NEAR Project and in its ecosystem.

### Token rewards

Every spec will be different. Many may not list specific rewards, particularly as we are figuring this out.  Your best path forward is to contact the producer of the spec or comment directly on it so they can engage with you and figure out what will make it worth it.
